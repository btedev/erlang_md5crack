2008-09-02:  Code for Intro to Erlang concurrency talk to be given at BarCamp Tampa unconference
(http://barcamptampabay.com/) on Oct. 11, 2008 by Barry Ezell.  I am new to Erlang and this
project is as much a learning experience as a teaching experience.  Erlang programmers
are welcomed to comment on or contribute to this code.  I can be reached at barrye _@t_ gmail.com

The goal of the application is to decrease the time necessary to perform brute-force decryption
of MD5-hashed passwords by using concurrent Erlang processes.  The code is for demonstration
only and is not fit for production.  Also, malicious hackers are encouraged to die a painful death.
Passwords must only be lowercase characters (no numbers) and the decrypt function must 
be told how long the password is.  To encrypt and decrypt the string "hello" in the Erlang shell, 
execute the following:

>c(pwd).
>X = pwd:encrypt("hello").
>pwd:decrypt(X,5,2).

The arguments to decrypt are (encrypted password, password length, number of processes to spawn).
In its current state, the program is concurrent but not distributed so the number of processes
to spawn will depend on the number of CPUs/cores available on the test system.
